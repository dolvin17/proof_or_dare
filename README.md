# 🃏 ZK Truths – Truth or Dare meets Web3

**ZK Truths** is a gamified mini app built for **World App**, reimagining the classic “Truth or Dare” as a Web3 powered social experience.

Users prove on-chain truths or complete real dares across ecosystems. It's powered by **World ID**, uses **ZK proofs** for selective disclosure, and integrates the **MiniKit SDK** to engage real humans in meaningful Web3 activity.

   - I attended ETHCannes  
   - I hold a HerDAO NFT  
   - I’m a smart contract dev on WorldChain
   - I’m a trader on WorldChain  
4. Or complete a Dare:
